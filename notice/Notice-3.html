<p>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been an integral part of our Group&rsquo;s vision and mission. The Group&#39;s Corporate Vision &lsquo;Let us develop with wisdom and prosper in harmony&rsquo; not only acts as a guiding principle for our business activities, but also forms our basic CSR philosophy. Founded on this principle, we always take into consideration the interest of the society and protection of the environment while conducting our business.<br />
<br />
We strongly believe that the definition of a successful organization is not just limited to its business achievements. Rather, it is also shaped in part by the positive and constructive role it plays in the society and environment. As a responsible corporate citizen, the group routinely participates in many activities aimed at sustainable development of society at large. We actively encourage our employees to volunteer their resources and time, in any possible capacity and extent towards various social causes.</p>
